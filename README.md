A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed for beginners. The game allows two players to take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. It features a clean interface, updates the board dynamically, and checks for a winner or a draw after each turn. This project demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts like event handling, conditionals, and DOM manipulation.
